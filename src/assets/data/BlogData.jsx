        <h3>Daily care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Wash your lashes at least once every day</strong> (use only
            a brush like the one I will give you to clean lashes, not cotton
            pads or make-up wipes)
          </li>
          <li>
            Brush them through gently with the little lash brush from mid length
            to ends (not from the very base as this can dislodge them)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Try not to sleep on your face!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use oil free products</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The first couple of days</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Try not to get super hot in the sun for 24 hours</li>
          <li>
            Avoid steam & sauna for 48 hours (steam will also reduce the life of
            the lashes in general)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Infills (lash top-ups)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Infills are best scheduled every 2-3 weeks</strong> to
            maintain your lashes
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Things to know</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Removal of eyelashes must be done by a professional lash artist
            </strong>
            , or you can let them grow out. Please don’t try to take them off
            yourself as you may damage your natural lashes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use oil free products around the eyes</strong> (use oil free
            make-up remover)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You don’t need to wear mascara</strong>, it will weaken the
            lashes (especially waterproof & oil based mascara)
          </li>
          <li>You can use oil free eyeliner products</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don’t use eyelash curlers</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Please don’t play with or pick at the lashes- this can cause trauma
            to your natural lashes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              We can lose roughly 0-5 lashes per day so don’t be alarmed if you
              see fallen lashes.

        <h3>Can you infill my lashes from another lash tech?</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t infill lashes that I haven’t applied myself, sorry. You can
          wait until you need a fresh set after 3 weeks or so or I can remove
          your lashes and apply a lovely fresh set for you.
        </p>
        <h3>How do infills work?</h3>
        <p>
          After 2-3 weeks of wearing eyelash extensions you will have shed a few
          lashes and the set will no longer look as full. This is a good time to
          check and top up your lashes.

        <h3>Classic</h3>
        <p>
          The classic lash is cylindrical and tapered from root to end. It gives
          a lovely classic finish and the lashes are soft. Each classic lash is
          bonded to one natural lash.
        </p>

        <p>
          I generally use a 0.15 diameter lash for classic application looks
          lovely. Anything heavier can look quite unnatural.
        </p>

        <h3>Hybrid</h3>
        <p>
          A blend of classic lashes and light handmade fans with three very fine
          lashes. A more feathery look between classic and light volume. Each is
          applied to one natural lash.
        </p>

        <h3>Light volume</h3>
        <p>
          Light handmade fans with three very fine lashes. A gentle but fuller
          light fluffy finish. One light 3D fan to one natural lash.

            Your lash technician should be properly trained & experienced and
            follow health & safety guidelines
          </li>
          <li>
            The products used should be sourced from suppliers who meet

          <li>One extension should be attached to only one eyelash</li>
          <li>
            For good retention the lash tech should monitor & control the
            temperature and humidity in the room following the chosen lash
            adhesive recommendations (they are all different)
          </li>
          <li>Washing and priming the lashes ensures the best retention</li>
          <li>
            Checking through every lash at the end of the application to ensure
            there are none sticking together is very important
          </li>
          <li>
            Finishing with bonder minimises fumes near the eye, reduces
            sensitivity, maximises retention and sets the adhesive. This isn’t
            compulsory but it really does help!
