        <h2>Accessibility Statement for https://casuarinalashes.com.au/</h2>
        <p>
          Casuarina Lashes is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for
          people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user
          experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility
          standards.
        </p>
        <h3>Conformance status</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements
          for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with
          disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level
          AA, and Level AAA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casuarina Lashes is making constant efforts to improve the
          accessibility of its site and services in the belief that it is our
          collective moral obligation to allow seamless, accessible, and
          unhindered use for those of us with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to make all pages and content on
          https://casuarinalashes.com.au/ accessible, but some content may not
          yet fully meet the highest accessibility standards. This could be due
          to challenges in identifying the most suitable technological solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may revise this Statement periodically to reflect improvements or
          changes to our accessibility practices.
        </p>
