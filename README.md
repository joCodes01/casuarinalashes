# Website rebuild with React.js (in progress)

This is a rebuild of a basic Wordpress Elementor website with React.js.


It is in the early stages! You can see my progress here: https://jocodes01.github.io/casuarinalashes/ (COMING SOON)

The original basic website I built and am copying is here: https://casuarinalashes.com.au/

currently adding components & content.
Soon to be styled.

## Goals

To put React skills into practice and become familiar with the basics.
using Vite: learning correct workflow for images, fonts, forms styling etc.
Add some subtle animations.

To release myself from web host and page builder fees
