# Website rebuild with React.js (in progress)

This is a simple static business website built with React.js

The purpose of this project is to learn the foundations of React.js and add to it over time whilst learning more.

I am doing eyelash services as a side business whilst learning to code.

The website can be seen here:

using Vite: learning correct workflow for images, fonts, forms styling etc.
